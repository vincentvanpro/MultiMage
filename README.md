# Game
This could be a good game.

The multiMage is a RPG & platformer multiplayer game where main heroes fight 
against ancient evil in dungeon.

# The Concept
You play as mage, you have a choice between archer-mage, meele-mage and 
staff/classic-mage. Your goal is to survive, as the more enemies you've killed,
the stronger enemies become. As you kill and progress with the game, your hero 
with his/her HP and damage from skills level up. You also can gain items that
boost characteristics. These items are all passive, which means you cannot use them.

# Script

# The goal

# Mechanics
Each item you get has effects, some of them are negative, some are positive.
Each hero has 3 slots for equipment - leg, chest and head armour. 
You can carry only one at one.
Other items do not have restrictions. 
Stacking an item changes one or more of its effects.
For example: item that blocks damage, +15%, the next you've gained will give a 
slitely less %, and this value cannot reach 100%.

We have the difficulty multiplier. This applies to an enemy strength.
As you progress through the game, it becomes harder and harder with every minute you mess around.
Each level you've passed also adds a difficulty.
