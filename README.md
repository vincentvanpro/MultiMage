# Game

This could be a good game.

The multiMage is a RPG & platformer multiplayer game where main heroes fight 
against ancient evil in dungeon.

# The Concept

You play as mage, you have a choice between archer-mage, meele-mage and 
staff/classic-mage. Your goal is to survive, as the more enemies you've killed,
the stronger enemies become. As you kill and progress with the game, your hero 
with his/her HP and damage from skills level up. You also can gain items that
boost characteristics. These items are all passive, which means you cannot use them.

# The goal

# Mechanics
Each item you get has effects, some of them are negative, some are positive.
Each hero has 3 slots for equipment - leg, chest and head armour. You can carry only one at one.
Other items do not have restrictions. 
Stacking an item changes one or more of its effects.
For example: item that blocks damage, +15%, the next you've gained will give a slitely less %, and this value cannot reach 100%.
