# Game

This could be a good game.

The multiMage is a RPG & platformer multiplayer game where main heroes fight 
against ancient evil in dungeon.

# The Concept

You play as mage, you have a choice between archer-mage, meele-mage and 
staff/classic-mage. Your goal is to survive, as the more enemies you've killed,
the stronger enemies become. As you kill and progress with the game, your hero 
with his/her HP and damage from skills level up. You also can gain items that
boost characteristics. These items are all passive, which means you cannot use them.

# Goal of the game

# Hero descryptions

# Enemies
